# python-arduino-clock
Get time from windows with python and send data one time to arduino

This is my firtst project using python and arduino, i wanted to make 
a digital clock to put under my monitor because is cool, but its not 
completed at all because of i had so many probelms with the time 
library of arduino so i gave up. Now it only send when you run 
python code the current time taken from your pc.
